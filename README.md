This is a Yii2 Project done by Arun Prabhakar. Git commit is done; but in-order to run the code you first clone this and download the composer.phar file then copy composer.phar to site root and go to the site root, run 

	php composer.phar update 

to get the files need. Go to the config/db.php and change the connection string to your present db. SQL is added in the repo as db.sql.

I take 3.15 hrs to do this work. Thank you.
